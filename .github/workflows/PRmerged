explanation: 

on: push with branches main, dev, staging: ensures your build job runs on all three for testing.

on: pull_request + types: closed + branches: main: this triggers when a PR to main is closed.

if: github.event.pull_request.merged == true: ensures the deploy job only runs if that PR was merged (and not just closed without merging).
